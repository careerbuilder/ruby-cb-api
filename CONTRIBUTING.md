# Contributing to CB API project
We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make it even better than it is currently!

# Reporting an issue
If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

# Requesting a feature
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.  If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the
project.  The best way to start this discussion is by opening an issue on our github repository.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the gitHub repository as a Pull Request.

# How code gets into the project

1. Always open a pull request
2. All pull request must come with coresponding tests
3. All pull requests will be peer reviewed (dont just accept them please :) )
